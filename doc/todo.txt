- extract layer hierarchy
- use '!' to indicate text within markup only visible for this layer: [foo!|A,B>bar<foo] means 'bar' is only shown in layer A and B -> this implicates that [foo!|A,B>bar [x|C>bar<x] bar<foo] is not allowed!?
- encoding of metadata, especially at the start of the tagml
- autocomplete for alexandria cli
- fix: xml export with default layer overlap doesn't create trojan horse xml!
